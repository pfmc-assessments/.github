# The pfmc-assessments GitHub Organization

Repositories used by those involved in stock assessments for U.S. West Coast
fish populations associated with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC).
Many of the contributors and users are at NOAA's [Northwest][NWFSC] and
[Southwest][SWFSC] Fisheries Science Centers.

Some of the commonly used repositories within this organization include

repository | use
-- | --
[nwfscSurvey] | Analysis of the NWFSC trawl surveys
[PacFIN.Utilities] | Manipulate data from the PacFIN database for assessments
[nwfscAgeingError] | Estimate ageing error given double-reads of hard
  structures (e.g., otoliths)
[nwfscDiag] | Diagnostics for west coast groundfish assessments
[sa4ss] | Generate a stock assessment document from Stock Synthesis output

Our [internal handbook for PFMC groundfish assessments][handbook] is another
useful resource.
