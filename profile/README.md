# The pfmc-assessments GitHub Organization

Repositories used by those involved in stock assessments for U.S. West Coast
fish populations associated with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC).
Many of the contributors and users are at NOAA's [Northwest][NWFSC] and
[Southwest][SWFSC] Fisheries Science Centers.

Some of the commonly used repositories within this organization include

There are also numerous repositories associated with U.S. west coast groundfish stock assessments that are hosted here, which are all associated with the topic "[stockassessment](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apfmc-assessments+stockassessment&type=Topic)".

Our [internal handbook for PFMC groundfish assessments][handbook] is another
useful resource.
